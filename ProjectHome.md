In a nuclear family of four, the Mendelian inheritance patterns can be grouped into four inheritance states for each variant position, with children receiving: 1) the same allele from both the mother and the father (identical), 2) the same allele from the mother but opposites from the father (haploidentical maternal), 3) the same allele from the father, but opposites from the mother (haploidentical paternal), and 4) opposites from both parents (nonidentical). Adjacent variant base pairs in alignments of the family genomes have the same inheritance state unless a recombination has occurred
between these bases in one of the meioses. This delineates inheritance blocks.
